# Introduction to Phishing

Phishing is a type of cyber attack where attackers attempt to deceive individuals into revealing sensitive information, such as passwords, credit card numbers, or personal data, by pretending to be a trustworthy entity. These attacks are typically carried out through deceptive emails, websites, or other digital communication methods.

## Why is Phishing Dangerous?

Phishing attacks can lead to significant security breaches, such as:
- **Identity theft**: When personal data like Social Security numbers, bank details, or login credentials are stolen.
- **Financial loss**: Fraudulent transactions or unauthorized access to bank accounts.
- **Reputation damage**: If an organization’s customers fall victim to phishing, it could harm the organization's reputation and trustworthiness.
- **Malware installation**: Phishing links may lead to the download of malicious software that can compromise your device or network.

Phishing remains one of the most common and successful methods used by cybercriminals. According to recent studies, a large percentage of cyber-attacks begin with phishing emails. It’s essential to understand how phishing works and how to defend against it.

## Common Phishing Methods

Phishing attacks come in various forms. Some of the most common ones include:
- **Email Phishing**: Fake emails that appear to be from legitimate sources (banks, companies, colleagues) and trick recipients into clicking malicious links or downloading harmful attachments.
- **Spear Phishing**: A more targeted form of phishing where the attacker customizes the message to a specific individual or organization.
- **Smishing**: Phishing via SMS (text messages), often with links to malicious websites or phone numbers to call.
- **Vishing**: Voice phishing, where attackers try to trick victims over the phone into disclosing confidential information.
